- 🔭 I’m interested in data modelling, warehousing and orchestration.
- 🌱 I’m currently building web scraping programs and data pipelines on GCP.

```python
def retry(one_more_time):
    def try_again(this, alive, success):
        if not alive or success(this):
            return this
        return try_again(one_more_time(this), heartbeat(bpm) > 0, success)
    return try_again
```
